:slightly_smiling_face: I am Konstantinos (aka Kostas) and I am a tech freak. Either it's a new programming language, a new database or a hardware breakthrough, it's sure we could have an interesting discussion on that.

:sunny: During daytime (usually :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:) I lead engineering teams and try to experiment with new tools.

:first_quarter_moon_with_face: If I am not hanging near a computer :computer: I am a full time dad and husband
